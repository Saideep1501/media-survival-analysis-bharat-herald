## 📌 Problem Statement

**Bharat Herald**, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper operating across five Indian states, is facing an existential crisis.

Between 2019 and 2024, print circulation dropped from **1.2 million to 560,000**, while digital-first platforms like **DigiHindi Post** and **InShorts** captured mobile-first audiences.  

A failed 2021 e-paper pilot due to poor mobile usability led to:
- Decreased advertiser trust  
- Financial losses  
- Bureau closures  
- 60+ layoffs  

The organization now faces a critical decision:  
**Adopt a data-driven digital strategy — or risk becoming obsolete.**
